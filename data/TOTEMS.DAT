* Creator Shaman|mits.160|Idol
<P>ENV: Urban or forest</P>
<P>DESC: The great artisan, the Creator shuns the splendor
of his fellow Idols, preferring instead to tinker
with his creations. Though this Idol did not
create the world, he did create many of its
treasures. Even more than his finished handiwork,
the Creator loves what is yet to be created. His
mind is so full of plans and ideas that deceit and
intrigue have no place there; there are many
legends of others taking advantage of his nature.
Like their Idol, Creator shamans often find
dealing with people awkward and uncomfortable.
Though trusting in nature, they make bitter and
determined enemies when wronged.</P>
<P>ADVAN: +2 dice for enchanting, +1 die for hearth and city
spirits</P>
<P>DISADVAN: -1 die for combat spells. When confronted with
something unusual or unique, a Creator shaman must

more. He is a big brother who takes a friendly
interest in everything his family does. Though
sometimes naive, he makes a staunch friend and a
deadly enemy. The dragons he slays have changed
with the times. In addition to the literal dragons
of legend, the Dragonslayer also fights such
modern-day monsters as crime, pollution and
corruption. Dragonslayer shamans fight hard and
play hard. Once the shaman has given his loyalty,
he never breaks it. A Dragonslayer shaman must
behave with honor and respect and demands the same
from those around him.</P>

envisions them. He is shaper and creator, forming
new things from the primal clay and breathing the
firey spark of life into them. Fire-Bringer
shamans devote themselves to the betterment of
others, even at their own expense. Most Fire-
Bringer shamans devote themselves to a particular
cause they follow with great zeal.</P>

\ Traditions INFO Notes
* Aboriginal Magic |mits.24|TRADITIONS
<P> The native people of Australia have a rich mythology and culture that date back tens of thousands of years and include a great deal of knowledge handed down from generation to generation through oral tradition. In the Sixth World, much of this knowledge likely came from previous ages of magic. The aboriginal Dreamtime is a timeless realm of magic and creative power much like the metaplanes. Aboriginal shamans are skilled astral travelers and possess a great deal of knowledge for dealing with the various powers that dwell there. The fact that Australia's Awakened outback is currently running wild is a direct result of the dying aboriginal culture, which left no one to direct and nurture the power of nature there.</P>
<p> Traditions: Aborigine magicians are almost exclusively shamans. following totems such as Badger, Crocodile, Scorpion, Shark and Snake. Some follow nature totems such as Sun, Moon, Sea or Mountain. Many are wilderness shamans (see p. 16). </p>
<p>Tools and Trappings: Aborigine magic commonly includes drumming and chanting. Quartz crystals are an important magical tool, along with opals and other stones. The rainbow is a common symbol, along with different totem animals.</P>
* Aztec Magic |mits.24|TRADITIONS
<P> Much of the Aztec magic in the Sixth World is a revival of traditions reconstructed from limited historical information, with the focus on the gods and totems of the ancient Aztec culture. Animal and human sacrifice is a predominant theme, so blood magic is common among initiates. This practice gives Aztec magicians a reputation as evil, though that may be largely undeserved.</P>
<p> Traditions: Aztec magicians are shamanic; common totems include Bat. Eagle, Jaguar, Lizard, Moon, Plumed Serpent, Puma, Snake and Sun. </p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Aztec magicians use elaborate ceremonial costumes for ritual magic, including feathered headdresses, and traditionally use an obsidian knife for blood sacrifices. Aztec magicians also use astrology for divining the future and determining auspicious days for their rituals.</P>
* Black Magic |mits.24|TRADITIONS
<P> Despite suffering bad reputations based on the very name of their tradition, most "black magic" groups aren't really evil. Most follow a credo that is part fascist and part hedonism, advocating freedom from all the constraints imposed by "straight" society but emphasizing a will to power. Steeped in Christian, hermetic and pagan symbolism, black magic groups are usually quite orderly in their magical outlook. Gamemasters can also include the stereotypical human-sacrifice type of black magic users if they so choose (see The Corrupted, p. 134), but most such groups don't adhere to the Hollywood portrayals of their art.</P>
<p> Traditions: Hermetic black magic magicians are often quite strict and disciplined. Shamanistic black magicians often follow idols such as the Adversary, the Horned Man or the Seductress.</p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Various reversed Christian symbols (upside-down cross, the Black Mass, and so on), the pentagram and a penchant for elaborate rituals. Blood sacrifice is not common. but gamemasters can include it for truly "evil" magicians.</P>
* Chaos Magic |mits.24|TRADITIONS
<P> Chaos magic began as an occult movement intended to create a "pure" magical system devoid of any dogma or credo that works with any belief system and transcends all of them. Chaos magic is a highly eclectic and post-modern style, incorporating many symbols and ideas from different cultures. </P>
<p>Traditions: Chaos magicians are usually hermetic, though they might interact with many different spirit beings and totems on astral quests.</p>
<p>Tools and Trappings: Chaos magic incorporates symbols and ideas from many sources. A chaos magic circle might include qabbalistic, runic and even shamanic design elements. Chaos mages are often technophiles and commonly use technology in their magic, such as CD players for background music, symbols "drawn" on LCD screens, and so on.</P>
* Christian Magic |mits.24-25|TRADITIONS
<P> Christianity has a very strong mystical tradition dating back to the first-century gnostics, and it is no surprise that many Christians attempted to reclaim some of their faith's magical heritage following the Awakening. Catholics and other Christian theologies carefully regulate the use of magic according to the tenets of their faith. Conjuring, in particular, is rigorously scrutinized lest the faithful be led into sin through such practices. There is a Catholic order of magician-priests, the Order of St. Sylvester, that investigates matters magical for the Holy Church.</P>
<p> Traditions: Most theurgists follow strict hermetic practices and belong to distinct hermetic schools (see p. 17). Some liberal and "revivalist" theologies produce shamanistic magicians, and :errain Catholics may treat various patron saints as idols (St. George or St. Michael as the Dragonslayer, for example). Some of  the more conservative groups still consider magic a tool of the devil, resulting in Christian magicians who don't believe that they use "magic" at all.</p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Christian magic uses the symbols of the Church, such as the Bible, the cross or crucifix and the rosary. Holy water is also a common element. God, Christ and various saints are often invoked. Some shamans have been known to speak in tongues or summon spirits of man that take on angelic forms. </P>
* Druidic Magic |mits.25|TRADITIONS
<P> The druids were ancient Celtic priests, shamans and philosophers. Unfortunately, because little is known about their practices and beliefs, much of modern Sixth World druidry has been reconstructed from both reliable and less reliable sources.

* Egyptian Magic |mits.25|TRADITIONS
<P> The ancient Egyptians believed in a complex system of magic  that divided the soul into many parts and studied the movements of the planets and stars. Magic was powered by an energy known as heka, known to modern magicians as mana. 'With the return of magic, some have taken up the ancient Egyptian ways.</P>
<p> Traditions: Heka magicians are pantheistic shamans, honoring the gods of ancient Egypt but not following any in particular. Their style of Sorcery is more akin to that of hermetics. The gamemaster may choose to allow heka pantheists +2 dice for summoning spirits of the desert, but -2 dice for summoning all Other spirits of the land. This modifier does not change.</p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Heka magicians use Egyptian symbols such as the ankh and the Eye of Horus. Contrary to popular belief, they do not make use of "pyramid power" or anything associated with that theory. Other common elements include sand, snakes, scarabs and burning herbs or incense.</P>

* Hindu Magic |mits.25|TRADITIONS
<P> Sixth World India is a land of mystery, its nearly overwhelming population decimated by waves of VITAS. India is now home to yogis and dervishes with strange, mystical powers (many of them adepts), and to esoteric knowledge, from the secrets of the Sanskrit language (considered by many to be the most mystical of tongues to Tantric sex magic and the Thugee cults of the death goodess Kali.

* Islamic Magic |mits.25-26|TRADITIONS
<P> Much like Christianity many followers of Islam hearken back to the era of their ancestors  when Islamic sorcerers were considered some of the most skilled in the world. Islamic mages are skilled in the various formulas and equations governing the use of magic, and they make excellent researchers and scholars. Islamic magic considers conjuring to be somewhat dangerous, but Islamic mages still call upon various djinn and ifrits (elementals).</P>
<p> Traditions: Islamic magicians are hermetic mages, usually following a specific hermetic school (see p. 16). </p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Arabic is the language of choice for spells. Verses from the Qu'ran are common.

* Norse Magic |mits.26|TRADITIONS
<P> Norse magic is divided into two main branches: galdor, the use of runes, and seidr, shamanic techniques for achieving trances and astral projection. Norse magicians follow the Aesir (the Norse gods) and make regular use of runes in their magic.</P>
<p> Traditions: Norse magicians are shamans who follow the idols of Odin/Wotan as Sky Father or Wild Huntsman, Thor as the Dragonslayer, Freya as the Great Mother, Loki as Trickster and Tyr as the Wise Warrior.

* Qabbalistic Magic |mits.26|TRADITIONS
<P> The qabbalah (spelled several different ways in English) is a Hebrew system of mystical correspondences intended to serve as a map for attaining wisdom and enlightenment regarding the universe. Many magical traditions have adapted and use the qabbalah as a "psychocosm" (model of the universe). Practitioners of the Hebrew mysteries make use of the qabbalah and its symbolism as a way of performing magic.</P>
<p> Traditions: Qabbalists are hermetic. Certain ultra-orthodox sects of Judaic qabbalah follow their own unique school (see p. 16). </p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Spells are spoken in ancient Hebrew, and qabbalistic diagrams and symbols are used on foci and hermetic circles. Qabbalistic magic users create golems, an ally spirit inhabiting a clay body (see p. 108).</P>
* Rastafarian Magic |mits.26|TRADITIONS
<P> Rastafarians are stereotyped as those who created reggae music and who smoke marijuana. Whether or not those characterizations are true, the Rastafarians are, in fact, a strongly religious group with a unique faith and magical practices. The basic religious beliefs of the Rastas are based on an Ethiopian king who took the name Ras Tafari. They believe that Jamaica is Hell and Ethiopia is the Promised Land, and that one day they will return there and so to paradise.</P>
<p> Traditions: Rastas are shamans.</p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Music and dance are common elements (particularly drumming). Smoking is also likely for certain rituals, though gamemasters must decide whether to include such elements in their games.</P>
* Shinto Magic |mits.26|TRADITIONS
<P> The Shinto religion of Japan is strongly focused on ancestor worship and the veneration of spirits of nature. The kami represent all manner of spirits, from humble nature spirits and ghosts to powerful free spirits that the Shinto miko must attempt to appease. The Japanese imperial family plays a strong role in the Shinto religion, and the Emperor is considered to be a kami in his own right, descended from Amaterasu the Sun Goddess. Perhaps during the last age of magic it was possible for a kami and a human to mate, resulting in a family line with a strong talent for magic. The same may have happened in other places around the world, resulting in the many human tales of divine offspring with magical gifts.
</P>
<p> Traditions: Miko are traditionally shamans. Some have patron kami as totems, while others follow nature totems such as Sun or Mountain, or occasionally an animal totem. Many miko summon ancestor spirits rather than spirits of man (see p. 106). </p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Common elements of Shinto ceremonies include meditation, prayer, chanting, burning incense and small paper charms that are kept or burned (these may be expendable spell foci). Nature spirits are likely to manifest in forms representative of ancient Japanese myth.</P>
* Witchcraft |mits.26|TRADITIONS
<P> Wicca, or the Craft of the Wise, exists in both shamanic and hermetic forms. Some witches are followers of nature magic. Others (usually more British and American) are mages who incorporate the religious observances of Wicca into their lives, but whose magic is distinctly influenced by the hermetic traditions found in England in the nineteenth century.</P>
<p> Traditions: Hermetic or shamanic, depending on the witch's background. Typical totems include Great Mother, Moon Maiden and Horned Man.</p>
<p> Tools and Trappings: Magical tools common in witchcraft include the dagger (athame), chalice, pentacle, wand, cauldron and broom. Witches commonly perform ritual magic according to the cycles of the moon.</P>
